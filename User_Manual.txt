Welcome to the user manual for ZoraNT!

This file here is meant to guide you on how to setup the necessary things to have Zora actually run since I'm too stupid to make proper applications!

Windows Installation Process:

First thing you'll want to do is install MSYS2. Keep everything in its default place as anything custom will break EVERYTHING.

Included inside the ZoraNT Source file will be two script, one being a batch script and the other being a Powershell script (ending in .bat and .ps1 respectivly, DO NOT click on the shell scripts);
they both do the same thing. It all just depends on which one you want to use.

When running either script, make sure they're in the same directory as the shell scripts and desktop source code!

It's recommended to run the batch script though (the file that ends with .bat) since its more well...automatic and easier to fix if broken.

All it's doing is checking if MSYS2 is installed, then it'll automatically open it, switch to the proper directory, and run the setup script (autostart script is seperate)

Of course (if you really want to) you could setup the environment manually. To what degree you do it though is your own preference; the windows specific scripts
were made simply for people who don't really know any of the commands.

Now, you simply run the quick_run script and it'll start, just like magic!
If you want top quit everything, simply just close out of MSYS2 (shutdown ZoraNT before doing so though!) since it's the lifeline of any program I make-
