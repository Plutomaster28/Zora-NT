## How to run
- Download the Zip
- Unzip the zip (It's recommended to move the unzipped ZoraNT-v1.0 directory that has everything inside into your "Downloads" directory)
- Run the MSYS2 installer
- Within the MSYS2 terminal, use `cd /c/Users/(user filled)/Downloads/ZoraNT-v1.0` to switch to the correct directory ("user filled means that this portion varies from person to person, if you do not know what to put there, open cmd and check what's on the screen, you should see "C:\Users\(the thing)", that third item, is what you fill in.)
- Now run `./setup_msys2.sh` within the terminal and wait.
- After everything, run `./ZoraNT.exe`[^1] to run the program!
- If you want to close out, simply just exit out of ZoraNT and the terminal

## Other things you might need
Alongside MSYS2, you might need Git.

[^1]: Unfortunately this is the only way to run the program as of 1/1/2025
